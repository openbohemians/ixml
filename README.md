## Indention Sensitive XML

While Markdown is obviously the current exemplar of markup formats, perhaps there is still room for a more radical departures? How would indention sensitive HTML fair?

```
<title> On the Nature of Markup
<author> George White

<ul>
  <li> This is a list item
       and this item keeps going.
  <li> And so is this

<div class=holy>
  Any attribute can be set too of course.
  Notice you can leave out the quotes.

<div .holy>
  But it also understand some CSS syntax so for instance
  <tt>.holy</tt> can be used instead of class.

  This is a paragraph.

  This is a new paragraph. And it will remain
  so as we type to the next line.

  Just like old school!

<pre>
  This is a pre section.
  It is indented at least four spaces.

<pre lang="basic">
  10 print "Hello!"
  20 goto 10
```
